# Fault-Detection-and-Classification-of-Transmission-lines-using-ML-models
In this study we provide a solutions for the problem arises due to the fault occurs in the transmission lines. As we know that the fault categories as:

As shown in the given information of MATLAB simulink model, we provided, through which we generate the datasets for two different types :- 1) Fault Detection 2) Fault Classification
