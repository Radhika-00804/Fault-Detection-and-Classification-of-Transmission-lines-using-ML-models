# Fault-Detection-and-Classification-of-Transmission-lines-using-ML-models
In this study we provide a solutions for the problem arises due to the fault occurs in the transmission lines. As we know that the fault categories as:

As shown in the given information of MATLAB simulink model, we provided, through which we generate the datasets for two different types :- 1) Fault Detection 2) Fault Classification
By doing changes in the model parameters we get different values at different faults which can use to further integrate with the ML models to get the better accuracy for both detection and classification the dataset generated consists of the data for all six classes represented in the classification section.
